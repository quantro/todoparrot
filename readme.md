## TODOParrot

TODOParrot ([http://todoparrot.com](http://todoparrot.com)) is the companion project to the forthcoming book, [Easy Laravel 5](http://easylaravelbook.com), written by bestselling PHP author [W. Jason Gilmore](http://wjgilmore.com). Be sure to check out the book website and subscribe to the notification list in order to receive a nice discount when it publishes. Otherwise, you can [purchase a beta version now on Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/easylaravel/) at a discounted cost, and receive free updates for life!

TODOParrot is built atop the forthcoming Laravel 5. While likely fairly unstable it nonetheless provides interested Laravel developers with the opportunity to have a look at Laravel 5's many new features, not to mention better understand how Laravel works in general. In particular it demonstrates implementation of the following features:

* Blade templating
* Model associations 
* Forms integration 
* Database queries 
* User authentication
* Unit testing

In the coming days and weeks I'll continue to improve TODOParrot as I continue writing and refining the book. In particular I plan on demonstrating the following features:

* Database seeding
* Advanced unit testing
* Password recovery
* Account confirmation
* List/task editing
* User preferences

### Installing TODOParrot
